suggestotron
============

This is the core RailsBridge Suggestotron code.  Write this code from the ground up by taking 
the [RailsBridge Ruby on Rails Intro Tutorial](http://installfest.railsbridge.org/curriculum/curriculum).  

Interested in hacking and extending this app to be more useful such as a vote-to-promote 
message board or a new and improved diebold-o-tron?  Climb aboard!  Helpful instructions for getting going will be up soon... 

The collaborators are friendly and the possibilities are endless.
